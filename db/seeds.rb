  {city: "Cape Town", country: "South Africa", continent: "Africa", article: "People who move to Cape Town often find themselves seduced into staying for far longer than they initially anticipated. Repeatedly featuring in and topping the lists of best cities in the world, Cape Town's popularity rests on its celebrated natural beauty, mild climate and the relaxed lifestyle of its residents.  It may be on the bottom end of the African continent but the Mother City, as it's often called, is anything but isolated. Shaped by its complicated history, the city's vibrant and cosmopolitan character is a mixture of colonial and local influences, and is home to an eclectic blend of people from all over in a city that feels part-African and part-European.  Expats moving to Cape Town can generally expect a laid-back atmosphere providing a healthy, balanced alternative to the high-stress work environment of more corporate cities. Attractions as diverse as internationally recognised wine farms, shark cage diving and hiking trails mean that locals enjoy an active and satisfying lifestyle. An additional plus is that peak-hour traffic is benign compared to Johannesburg, especially for residents of the City Bowl in and around central Cape Town.   The cost of living in Cape Town is reasonable; however, with lower salaries than in Johannesburg and its abundance of hedonistic attractions, expats may struggle to save. Still, whether an outdoor enthusiast, lover of the arts or a gourmet connoisseur, it's easy to live the good life in the Cape.   Though relatively small, Cape Town has all the trappings of an international metropolis with gourmet dining, world-class shopping and high quality private healthcare. It is also a coastal city known for its beaches, and is home to thriving businesses at the forefront of their fields.  Cape Town is at the heart of South Africa's information technology industry and was selected to be the World Design Capital for 2014, in recognition of its growing digital and creative sectors. Port activities, the local film industry and financial services also make significant contributions to the region's gross domestic product.   The city is also home to some of South Africa's best-known educational institutions, including Bishops Diocesan College, one of four Rhodes Scholarship schools in the world; and the University of Cape Town (UCT), the highest ranked university on the continent.  Cape Town is arguably South Africa’s most efficiently run metropolis and, although there are high risk areas, the city centre and the suburbs where expats are likely to live are relatively safe. While its public transport network could be better, the introduction of the MyCiTi Rapid Bus Transport system means that it is easier for residents to get around than ever before. Most expats do, however, choose to own a car. Generally speaking, expats should easily adjust to living in Cape Town.", lat: "-33.925278", twitter_feed: "", book_suggestion: "", lon: "18.423889"},
  {city: "Buenos Aires", country: "Argentina", continent: "South America", article: "Expats moving to Buenos Aires will find it to be one of the most developed cities in Latin America. Affectionately referred to as the “Paris of the South”, Buenos Aires is Argentina’s largest metropolitan area with nearly 3 million city residents. The Greater Buenos Aires region has a population of over 15 million people. Expats relocating to this non-stop urban centre of action will find themselves surrounded by beautiful people and European architecture. Buenos Aires is not only the birthplace of the sultry and sensual tango, but also Latin America’s polo capital. Buenos Aires is the capital of Argentina   Along with cities such as Brussels, Chicago, Kuala Lumpur, Madrid, Moscow, Mumbai, Seoul and Toronto, Buenos Aires is ranked by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network as an Alpha City, based on its cultural, economic, infra-structural and political characteristics.   Expats moving to Buenos Aires can expect the same civic services available to any metropolitan area in Western Europe or the United States. This includes an efficient and easy to use public transportation system, free healthcare for anyone (regardless of immigration or tourist status) and free higher education at undergraduate level.   Buenos Aires has become an acclaimed expat hotspot as it offers a high standard of living, a multitude of activities, an exciting night life and excellent housing options in a wide variety of neighbourhoods (barrios) - all at a great value for those arriving with dollars, euro or pounds.   The only real downside to moving to Buenos Aires is that unemployment rates are high, but many expats either work for multi-national companies or are self-employed, typically working via the Internet.   Most important for foreigners considering moving abroad, Buenos Aires offers an amazingly rich and varied culture in a city where the local population is open to expats. Known as a crossroads of diverse backgrounds, ethnicity, history and people; the metropolis is home to one of the most viable and productive design industries in Latin America and was named the first UNESCO City of Design on 24 August 2005 by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Association.    It follows that the arts are widely appreciated in Buenos Aires, and the city’s cultural life spans the fields of architecture, fashion, theatre, music and dance with a keen focus on incorporating the latest styles, technology and know-how. Hundreds of acres of parks, gourmet restaurants, chic fashion boutiques, cultural events and more, delve out space and solidify the Argentine capital's commitment to a lofty aesthetic.   Buenos Aires is a city whose social life is geared towards the later hours, with dinner commonly taken after 10pm. Theatre performances usually start around 9pm and the last movie typically begins after midnight. The locals love to party and alcohol does not necessarily play a vital role in night life. Clubs usually do not begin to fill up until 2 or 3am and it's common for locals to be out dancing until 6am and then head to work at 8am.   Overall, Buenos Aires is a city that offers expats a high quality of life at a greatly discounted price compared to Europe or the United States.", lat: "-34.603333", twitter_feed: "", book_suggestion: "", lon: "-58.381667"},
  {city: "Medellin", country: "Colombia", continent: "South America", article: "Dear Live and Invest Overseas Reader,  If anyone had told me a year ago that today I would be living in Colombia, I would have laughed.  Back then, I knew little of the country, except where it was in the world and what it had once been famous for. I had no expectations when I planned my first visit. At the time, I thought I would be just passing through on my way to find where I wanted to settle in Latin America.  “You’re going where?” people would ask, surprised at my choice of relocating to the other side of the world. For me, it was a simple matter of wanting a better quality of life than I could expect living in England. I believe that’s what Latin America offers, every lifestyle element I was looking for—salsa dancing, a great climate, and, most important, a chance to remove myself from the nine-to-five rat race that I no longer wanted to be part of. I took off to find out if I was right. I left England on a one-way ticket, unsure where, or even if, I would find the place I wanted to call home.  But as the plane flew into Colombia, I felt an overwhelming and complete certainty that this was where I wanted to be.  Once one of the most dangerous cities in the world, Medellín is now a global success story. As recently as two decades ago, parents were afraid to send their children to school for fear they might never see them again. Fast forward to 2013 and Colombia’s second-largest city is awarded the World’s Most Innovative City Award, beating out Tel Aviv and New York.  So why do I love living in Medellín?  It’s not called the city of eternal spring for nothing. The pleasant 27 degrees Celsius year-round is definitely a bonus. Yes, it rains, and there are storms, but, because the city is situated in a valley, those storms are amazing to watch from the windows of an apartment with a view.  Which leads to another thing I love about Medellín—the views. Each morning I feel so lucky to be able to stare out at the mountains and the city skyline in the distance. I have been to 84 countries, and I’ll take this city for views any day… and also at night, when Medellín lights up.  Like many Brits, I love football, and the Colombians do, too. Being here for the World Cup and supporting both England and Colombia was a great experience. Football games are constantly being shown across the city, in shopping malls, bars, and restaurants, and I love that I can get the Premiership here. I just need to find a man who doesn’t mind me watching footie as we dine.  A night out here is so much cheaper than in the UK, and I’ve adapted to the paisa customs—like the bottle of aguardiente, you drink in shots throughout the evening. One of my passions is dancing, and Colombians love to dance—salsa, bachata, reggaeton, and, my favorite, electronic, which I find in some clubs.  Taxis are economical and everywhere, so it’s so easy to get around. Not having been able to afford taxis in the UK, I now take them everywhere.  Which leads to another important thing I like about Medellín—the cost of living here. In London, I lived in a little box. Here in Medellín, I’ve lived in a penthouse, something I never thought I’d be able to afford. But living in that penthouse cost half as much as my tiny apartment in London.  However, the real reason this city has blown me away is its energy. The energy of the mountains surrounding the valley and the energy of the people who live here. The people of Medellín are really proud of their city, and that pride is contagious. Locals say hello, and the security guards are beyond friendly. Policeman wave as they pass in their trucks, and you see hardly any litter. Even the poorest residents are made to feel part of the city with regeneration projects such as the cable car and outdoor escalators that provide public transport for those in the pueblos on the mountains.  Medellín has come so far in the last two decades, and I am so proud to call this city home today. This is a place of people who only look ahead, not behind.  I came to Latin America with the hope that I would find a new home, and I didn’t get any farther than the first country I visited. They say that home is where the heart is, and Medellín definitely has my heart.  Though I admit there are days when I find myself dreaming of marmite on toast and a cup of English tea, I know that I am where I am meant to be.", lat: "6.230833", twitter_feed: "", book_suggestion: "", lon: "-75.590556"},
  {city: "Budapest", country: "Hungary", continent: "Central Europe", article: "Budapest is Eastern Europe’s up and coming expat hotspot and an increasing number of people are relocating to Budapest each year. And no wonder, the Hungarian capital has all the things Western European cities have to offer – good quality of living, diverse culture and attractive job opportunities – with a much lower cost of living.  Ever since Hungary joined the EU in 2004, an increasing number of international companies have opened branch offices in Budapest, making more lucrative positions available for expats than the traditional language teacher jobs. An important thing to keep in mind when you are negotiating your salary for your new job in the Hungarian capital is that although the salary you are offered may be lower than you expected, you may come out ahead in the end, as life in Budapest is cheaper than in many Western European cities.  Once you have snagged that dream job abroad, you need to choose where you want to live. Budapest is divided into 23 districts – 6 in Buda on the west side of the Danube River, 16 in Pest on the east side, and the final one in an island in the middle of the river.  A majority of expats choose to live in Buda because it offers more quiet residential areas and lovely green spaces. Where you choose to live depends on your budget. District 2 (Pesthidegkút) has many expensive villas, especially in the Rózsadomb (Rose Hill) neighborhood, but also less pricy apartments. Many people like this district as it is quiet and clean, near many public schools and not too far from the city center. District 12 (Buda Hills) is also quiet while still lying within close proximity to the downtown area. Many prominent Hungarian politicians live there, including the president and prime minister.  For expats on a budget, several districts on the east side of the Danube in Pest may offer more practical housing options. District 14 (Zúgló) is the preferred choice of many expat families. It has reasonable housing prices as well as many historical residential buildings. The district is home to the Budapest Zoo and Botanical Garden and an expansive city park. Expats living here will be able to reach downtown Pest quickly and easily.  District 13 (Downtown) lies between Zúgló and the Danube. New residential buildings are currently being built in this district, which offer nice options for expats with a smaller paycheck. The neighborhoods in this district are still clean and safe, despite being located in downtown Pest.  If you are coming to Budapest as a young and single expat, you should consider renting an apartment in District 5 (Belváros), which is the heart of the city, located right on the Danube. You’ll be right at the center of all the nightlife action. This district offers lots of housing options, from nice and expensive apartments to cheap and run-down ones. There is also a good chance that you will be working in this district, as it is the city’s financial hub and home to the Hungarian seats of many international companies.  Before you move to Budapest, joining the Expatriate Community of InterNations is a good way to get in contact with other expats before your arrival. In the housing forum, you can ask expats already living in Budapest about their experiences renting or buying in the various districts of the city. In other sections of the forum, you can get answers to your questions about reasonable salary expectations, the cost of living, international schools and child care for your children and much more.  Once you arrive in Budapest, you can meet expats face-to-face at InterNations Events and Activities. It is important to also meet some locals, though, and make an effort to learn the Hungarian language and about the country’s culture. You will find that Hungarians are very proud of their language and their rich cultural heritage. Especially if you are staying for an extended assignment, taking these steps will help you feel more at home abroad and less like an eternal tourist.", lat: "47.4925", twitter_feed: "", book_suggestion: "", lon: "19.051389"},
  {city: "Roatan", country: "Honduras", continent: "Central America", article: "When you close your eyes and picture your dream retirement, what do you see? How about smooth, powder-white sand beaches and crystal blue water, all wrapped up with moderate, year-round weather at an affordable price? The beautiful island of Roatan Honduras, can offer expats all of the above and the best part is, you don’t have to be dreaming to make it a reality. Roatan Honduras Timothy Wildy The largest of the Bay Islands, Roatan can be found just off the northern coast of mainland Honduras, encompassed by the clear, warm waters of the Caribbean. Approximately 31 miles long and less than 5 miles wide at its widest point, Roatan only has a population of around 28,400 people, but this island paradise attracts thousands of tourists to its pristine shores each year. In fact, Island Magazine named Roatan the #1 island in the world to retire to in 2011 and it was also listed on Kiplinger.com as one of “8 great places to retire abroad”. But what is it about Roatan, Honduras, that is making expats choose this island over the many other fantastic Central American retirement destinations out there? Scenic beauty and the perfect climate Along with unspoiled beaches, lush forests, and the turquoise waters of the Caribbean, Roatan also has that year-round moderate weather that so many expats crave. As is expected in any tropical environment, there are hot and rainy seasons in Roatan.  The first rainy season will occur from June to July and the second (the winter rainy season) will span from October to February respectably. The average temperature in Roatan is a perfect 28°C, with the lowest temperature being around 22°C and the highest, 31° C. So pack away your heavy coats, for in Roatan, you will never need more than a light jacket to be comfortable. It’s not yet thick with crowds Although this may change as Roatan continues to gain recognition, the island is not yet densely populated. If you choose to settle down in Roatan, you will be free of some of the crowds that would be simply unavoidable in other popular expat spots in Central America. Actually the current balance is quite ideal. Because Roatan is not yet congested with tourists, the prices remain very affordable, and yet, because the tourism industry is an important aspect of Roatan’s economy, the island is filled with amenities like restaurants and bars that can be great additions for local expats. There is an established expat community Again, even though Roatan isn’t overrun with tourists and expats, there is definitely an established expat community in Roatan Honduras. And with 4 modern supermarkets, bilingual schools (teaching English and Spanish) and other first world amenities available on the island, adjusting to Roatan life can be made a little easier for North American expats. Friendly locals In Roatan, expats can not only expect to be welcomed by their fellow expats, but by the friendly locals as well. The local people in Roatan, Honduras, are made up of a unique blend of cultures from different ethnic backgrounds, but the largest population of locals are of Indian and Spanish decent. And while Spanish is the national language in Honduras, many locals also speak good English and some are even predominantly English speaking, which makes communicating in Roatan easy for North American expats. A home away from home One of the major dilemmas that many retirees face when deciding on a location for a second, or even primary home, is how much distance they are willing to put between them and their families back in the U.S. On the one hand, relocating to an affordable tropical paradise may sound almost too good to be true, but on the other, not being able to run over to see the grandkids every day could be a deal breaker for some expats. A home in Roatan, Honduras, can be the perfect solution for expats in this predicament. Honduras is only a short 2.5 hour flight from Houston, Texas, and with flights arriving to and from on a daily basis, North American expats can realistically be lounging on the beach one day and enjoying Thanksgiving with their families the next. It’s easy to get residency Getting residency in Roatan is a relatively simple process and you can be granted a retirement Visa as long as you can prove that you have a monthly income of $1,500. Once you’ve acquired that, you can own up to ¾ acres of land in your own name, the property taxes are very low and any foreign earned income will not be taxed at all. It’s a great time to buy The real estate market in Roatan is actually related to the U.S. economy, which consequently, is where the largest number of Roatan expats hail from. After the housing crisis that reached an all-time low in 2008, the housing market in the U.S. is beginning to improve and the market today is prime for buyers due to extremely low prices. The same goes for Roatan, but just like in the states, these low prices won’t stick around indefinitely.", lat: "16.383333", twitter_feed: "", book_suggestion: "", lon: "-86.4"},
  {city: "Prague", country: "Czech Republic", continent: "Central Europe", article: "Living abroad defines a new normal. Instincts, automated processes, the things you do just because that’s how they’re done, have suddenly changed. The new normal is defined by others, by your new surroundings. As an outsider, an expat, learning these new habits can be fun, painful, and can serve as an interesting insight into where you come from and why you value what you do. Or think you do. Here are some big takeaways from my life as an American expat living in Prague.  1. Go to the nature  The nature can be anywhere beyond buildings. Be in the grass, be in the mountains, walk through the park, swim in the water. Just be in the nature. There are over 38,500 km of well marked hiking trails that connect the baltic sea to the black sea and all routes in between. I’ve been told the Czech obsession with “the” nature stems from their communist past where physical and mental escapes were limited and dangerous to achieve. In a world shrouded in functionalism it was an act of selfish pleasure to do something so pointless, so useless, as to sit below a willow tree and appreciate life.  mushrooms in the nature Somewhere between Telč and Znojmo I found Alice’s poison 2. Thank Ježíšek for those presents, not the person who actually gifted you Hold it right there! Don’t write your name on that Christmas present. Why, you ask? You bought it for them and you want them to know it’s from you, you say? Wrong. It’s from Jesisek (little Jesus). All the gifts, including the decorated Christmas tree are from Ježíšek. “Děkuju Ježíšku!” … then look awkwardly at the person you think bought it for you.  3. Accept Czechnology. It does the trick. Deal. A car bumper held to the hood via 6 short bungie cables. Garbage bags in place of waterproof gear. Internet cables hanging from the roof of your 6 story building squishing through your windows. Vast amounts of duck tape. Vast. This is Czech technology, or Czechnology, at it’s best. It’s prevalent. It’s ghetto. It works.  Czechnology This car has been parked in front of my flat for 6 months 4. Write everything in a day planner. Everything. More powerful than the will of god, the almighty day planner will lead your life. If it is written, it shall be done. Czechs mean business when they commit to a date. And they commit early, which leads me to my next point.  5. Plan meetings with friends … 3 or 4 weeks in advance I once had a friend refer to a meeting that was planned one week in advance as “last minute”. It was to bake pumpkin bread together. A meeting can mean anything. It can be used to express hanging out, meeting up, exchanging goods, getting a drink together, lending sugar. Almost anything that puts you face to face with another person is referred to as a meeting. Maybe in Czech there is an expression for “hang out” but I haven’t made it that far in my Czech lessons.  6. Drink coffee sitting down Cafe hopping is a common pass time of mine. I rarely order coffee togo, though it’s possible. It’s better to sit down, be served and enjoy your drink. My favorite cafes in Prague are Prague Coffee House, Můj šálek kávy, Cafe Jen, Le Caveau, and Mama Coffee.  cappuccino time In the backyard at my home away from home, Prague Coffee House 7. Drink alcohol, it’s good for you You’re hungover, ill, tired, perfectly healthy, coughing, sneezing, nauseous, have a headache, a sore back, a sore ego. Some form of alcohol is in order to make you healthy. After all, nazdravi! (cheers!, ¡salud!, kanpai!) means ‘to health.’ There’s only one reason to stay sober …  8. Keep one person sober on Christmas, someone will choke on a carp bone Not really, even babi is slamming back the shots. But those tiny bones from that nasty bottom feeding fish (sorry Czechs, I miss my roast) are prone to lodging in your throat and someone will need to drive the victim to the hospital. Honestly, I’ve never heard of this actually happening to anyone on Christmas, but the threat seems to be cautiously vocalized every year.  9. Be politically incorrect Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue if a massive middle finger sculpture was planted on the white house lawn days before a presidential election? Known for his crawling babies, and now, long purple fingers – or finger rather, David Černý sums up how Czechs artistically and skillfully show political dissent.  David Cerny middle finger If it wasn’t clear enough, he added a few extra feet to that middle finger. 10. Recycle everything I love the Czech habit of recycling. On every street corner there are plastic, paper, glass, garbage and tetra-pack bins. Most neighborhoods also have a recycling bin for textiles and electronics. Recycle old light bulbs at many grocery stores (Tesco Express up from my place) and receive money back for beer bottles at your local potraviny. About 70% of Czechs recycle, and though not as prevalent, many compost too.  11. High school reunions don’t happen That’s because monthly high school reunions happen. It’s more formal than meeting with a bunch of friends you happened to go to high school with, but less formal than any high school reunion in America. There are different levels of high school in Czech and some can be for up to 8 years. That’s like high school times two. That’s a lot of bonding time.  12. Take the tram everywhere The 22 tram line feels like my personal shuttle services. 24 hour connections, 3-5 minute wait during peak hours, 15 minute wait at 4am. Prague feels like a city that you can know and understand. I personally have a terrible sense of direction, but Prague is so accessible and identifiable that even a lost bird like me can find its way.  22 tram Dear 22 tram, I love you. 13. Travel with bread, salami, and gingerbread This is a hard truth of traveling with a Czech. I’ve argued my way out of shopping at Tesco before going to Japan and Brazil, but every other destination was plagued by a loaf of Czech bread, a role of salami, and an assortment of Czech snacks. Czech gingerbread can serve a purpose. Like that one time in Edinburgh when a Czech guy exchanged our gingerbread for £2.40, the exact amount we needed to take the night bus to the airport. Other than serving as currency to homesick Czechs abroad, the gingerbreads have no purpose.

By some measures the largest city in the world, Shanghai welcomes the world from its position on the estuary of the Yangtze River, and boasts one of the largest ports in the world.   While Beijing and Hong Kong are perhaps more likely to capture the imaginations of those looking to move to China, Shanghai has functioned as a gateway for commerce between the East and the West for more than a century.   The city continues to be the gateway to China's vast economy and is the country's leading financial centre. Its willingness to attract international business and its adaptive spirit mean that Shanghai’s foreign population continues to grow steadily. Among them are some of the best and brightest in fields such as finance, biomedicine, high-tech industries and education.   Expats moving to Shanghai become part of this skilled workforce, often joining one of the many international companies that continue to open branches in a city on the cutting edge of global economics.   For decades, Shanghai has grown upwards and sprawled outwards, with glass, concrete and steel sprouting up between ancient temples, forest parks and traditional neighbourhoods nestling distinctly Western-looking areas.

The majority of the expats I’ve met out here are fresh off the boat and just dipping their toes into an international lifestyle. Many have investments elsewhere—a house they’re still paying the mortgage on, the next promotion, aging parents—that will inevitably summon them back after a few years. Expat children are sent to international school and expected to attend university back “home.”  This isn’t the place for those who want to immerse themselves in Asia; it’s a clean, safe outpost for doing business in the region.
